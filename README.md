# Obsidian Vault
## Overview
Welcome to my **Obsidian Vault**! This repository contains my personal Obsidian setup, including my notes, templates, and configurations. My Obsidian Vault serves as my second brain â€” a digital space where I organize thoughts, ideas, research, and projects. It's a place for knowledge management, learning, and self-improvement.
